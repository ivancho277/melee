            I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from
            the front to the back nod, back nod. Now who thinks their arms are
            long enough to slap box, slap box?. Let me show you maintaining this
            shit ain't that hard, that hard. Everybody want the key and the
            secret. To rap immortality like I have got.I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm
            the real Shady. All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating. So
            won't the real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please
            stand up?. 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady. All you
            other Slim Shadys are just imitating. So won't the real Slim Shady
            please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?My tea's gone
            cold. I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain
            clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could
            it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that
            it's not so bad, it's not so bad.
